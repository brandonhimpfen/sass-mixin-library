Sass Mixin Library is a simple, lightweight, yet powerful mixin library for Sass.

## How-to Use

Copy the `_mixins.scss` file and `mixins` directory to your project. Add the following to your core file or file in which you want mixins to be added:

  @import "mixins";

## Examples

Each mixin file located in the mixins directory contains documentation on how-to include the mixin.

Example of implementation can also be found in test.scss.
